# RACS2 (ROS and cFS System 2) Bridge

## Overview

This repository is a collection of software and examples that bridge message communication between Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) nodes and core flight executives (cFE).  cFE is a core component of NASA-supplied spacecraft software, Core Flight System (CFS).

This project provides the following 2 components,

- ROS2/cFE message bridge software
- ROS2/cFE examples

  - See below.
    - [ROS2 Installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
    - [cFS Installation](https://github.com/nasa/cFE)
    - [OSAL Installation](https://github.com/nasa/osal)

### Procedure

- Preparing for WebSocket.
  - C/C++ :
    ```
    sudo apt install -y libwebsockets-dev
    ```
  - Python :
    ```
    pip install websockets
    ```

- Preparing for Protocol Buffers.
  - C/C++ :
    ```
    sudo apt install -y libwebsockets-dev protobuf-c-compiler libprotobuf-c-dev
    ```
  - Python :
    ```
    pip install protobuf
    ```

- git clone the [RACS2 Bridge](https://github.com/jaxa/racs2_bridge.git) source code.

- Preparation of execution environment on the cFS side.
  - Go to the top of the cFS project directory and execute the following build command
    ```
    cp cfe/cmake/Makefile.sample Makefile
    cp -r cfe/cmake/sample_defs sample_defs
    ```

  - Bridge application placement in the cFS execution environment.
    ```
    cp -pr racs2_bridge/cFS/Bridge/Client_C/apps/racs2_bridge_client [cFS project path]/apps/
    cp -p racs2_bridge/cFS/Bridge/Client_C/sample_defs/* [cFS project path]/sample_defs/
    ```

  - Go to the top of the cFS project directory and execute the following build command
    ```
    make prep
    make
    make install
    ```

- Preparation of execution environment on the ROS2 side.
  - Bridge node placement in the ROS2 execution environment.
    ```
    cp -pr racs2_bridge/ROS2/Bridge/Server_Python/bridge_py_s [ROS2 project path]/src/
    ```
  - Go to the top of the ROS2 project directory and execute the following build command
    ```
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```

- Start the ROS2 node.
  ```
  cd [ROS2 project path]
  source install/setup.bash
  ros2 run bridge_py_s bridge_py_s_node  --ros-args --params-file ./src/bridge_py_s/config/params.yaml
  ```

- Start the cFS application.
  ```
  cd [cFS project path]/build/exe/cpu1
  ./core-cpu1
  ```

- Start the ROS2 publishers and subscribers.

- Start the cFS publishers and subscribers.
